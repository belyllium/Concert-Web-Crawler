# Web crawler for Concerts
## VERSION : 0.1

This is a Python code for organizing concert information.

Result will be stored in Pandas DataFrame.

Tested on **Python 3.8.18**

Currently it works for LA Phil website and can crawl only scrolling type page. It will be updated.

My goal is to make it generally working for any kind of concert halls, sports matches, etc.
