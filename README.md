# Web crawler for Concerts
## VERSION : 0.1

This is a Python code for organizing concert information.
Tested on **Python 3.8.18**

Currently it works for LA Phil website and can crawl only one month. It will be updated soon.

My goal is to make it generally work for any kind of concert halls, sports matches, etc.
